Oracles are capable of summoning massive orbs of fire as well as buffing their own power and weakening those around them resulting in them being a force to be reckoned with on the field."

The mirror realm is an infinite reflection of the real world and folds out in four dimensions, allowing multiple places to exist in the same area. Due to the amount of mass present in a single point in the mirror dimension, it contains a near infinite amount of energy allowing Globs to harness its power for their own uses. Sometimes this power gains sentience and wraps space around itself creating a fractal. "

Non-summoners who know how to summon Globures often use them to block off choke points or stop pursuers due to their priority target status given to them by many teams. "
